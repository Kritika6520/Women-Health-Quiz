        "PCOS often causes weight gain, acne, and hair loss because of metabolic disturbances, insulin resistance, and androgen excess.",
        "Studies estimate around 1 in 5 women globally experience PCOS, but many remain undiagnosed due to lack of awareness.",
        "PCOS increases insulin resistance, making the body process sugar improperly, which raises the risk of type 2 diabetes over time.",
        "Early signs like irregular menstruation, facial hair, and adult acne are often overlooked, delaying diagnosis and management.",
        "A combination of balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and sleep regulation can greatly reduce PCOS symptoms and complications.",
        "Uncontrolled PCOS increases long-term risk of developing diabetes due to persistent insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.",
        "Insulin resistance is central in PCOS â€” it worsens blood sugar control, promotes fat storage, and disturbs hormone regulation.",
        "A gynecologist specializes in female reproductive health and can diagnose PCOS through medical history, symptoms, blood tests, and ultrasound.",
        "Vitamin D deficiency is often found in women with PCOS and may worsen insulin resistance and inflammation, though research is ongoing.",
        "PCOS cannot be fully cured but proper lifestyle changes, medications, and hormonal therapies help manage symptoms and prevent complications.",
        "Stress triggers the release of cortisol and affects other hormones, making PCOS symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and acne worse.",
        "PCOS can interfere with ovulation, making it harder to conceive naturally, but many women conceive successfully with proper medical support.",
        "Good quality sleep helps regulate hormones like insulin, cortisol, and reproductive hormones, which directly impacts PCOS symptom control.",
        "Detecting PCOS early allows better lifestyle changes, preventing serious issues like diabetes, heart problems, and infertility later."];
